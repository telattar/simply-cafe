## Features

#### User Authentication

Secure user registration and login functionality. **How?**

- [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) is used to salt and hash the password during signup instead of using other encryption techniques.
- Each authenticated user is given a signed JWT token at login.
- User roles are checked at each endpoint to make sure users are **authorized** to do a specific action.

#### Product Management and Order Processing

CRUD operations for managing coffee shop products and handling customer orders, including order creation, updating, and deletion. Please refer to the API Endpoints section for more information.

#### Integration Testing

Comprehensive tests using Jest and Supertest.
